<h2>Research Bazaar - R Stream</h2>

<!--
  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->
<p>
  Participants enrolled in the "Programming and Data Analysis in R"
  stream at the
  <a href="http://resbaz.tumblr.com/conference">Research Bazaar conference</a>
  will attend a Software Carpentry workshop on the first two days.
  The mission of the <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a>
  project is to help researchers be more productive by teaching them basic
  computing skills. Researchers often spend much of their time wrestling
  with software, but most are self-taught programmers. As a result, they
  spend hours doing things that should take minutes, reinvent a lot of
  wheels, and still don't know if their results are reliable. To tackle
  this problem, Software Carpentry runs two-day workshops at
  <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/workshops/previous.html">hundreds
  of sites around the world</a>. These hands-on workshops cover basic
  concepts and tools, including program design, version control, data
  management, and task automation. Participants are be encouraged to
  help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own
  research problems.
</p>

<!--
  Explain who your audience is.  (In particular, tell readers if the
  workshop is only open to people from a particular institution.
-->
<p>
  <strong>Who:</strong>
  The workshop is restricted to 
  <a href="http://resbaz.tumblr.com/conference">Research Bazaar</a> attendees  
  who signed up for the "Programming and Data Analysis with R" stream.

<!--
  Modify the block below if there are any special requirements.
-->
<p>
  <strong>Requirements:</strong>
  Participants are asked to bring their laptop. They will be given access to
  the <a href="http://dit4c.metadata.net/">Data Intensive Tools for the Cloud</a>
  (DIT4C) environment on the
  <a href="http://its.unimelb.edu.au/research/our_services/cloud_computing/research_cloud">NeCTAR Research Cloud</a>,
  so it's critical that this laptop is able to connect to either the UniWireless
  or Eduroam wifi networks (see wifi and DIT4C login instructions <a href="#setup">below</a>).
  The DIT4C environment has all the required software installed, however there are software
  installation instructions <a href="#software_install">below</a> for participants who would like to
  install the software on their own laptop. Also note that participants are required to
  abide by Software Carpentry's
  <a href="{{site.swc_site}}/conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>.

<h2>Schedule</h2>

<p>
  The class schedule will be released closer to the event. As well as 
  attending this Software Carpentry workshop, people who signed up for
  the "Programming and Data Analysis with R" stream will have the
  opportunity to attend a number of other elective classes at ResBaz. 

<!--
  Display the Etherpad for the workshop.  You will probably set this
  up on the first day, so make sure you push changes to GitHub after
  you have its URL.  To create an Etherpad, go to

      http://etherpad.mozilla.org/YYYY-MM-DD-site

  where 'YYYY-MM-DD-site' is the identifier for your workshop (e.g.,

  1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
     around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<h3>Wifi</h3>

<p>
  Prior to the workshop, University of Melbourne staff/students should ensure that their 
  laptop can connect to UniWireless. Instructions on how to do this and where to get 
  assistance can be found 
  <a href="https://its.unimelb.edu.au/help/networks-access/networks-internet/connect-wireless/unimelb">here</a>.
  Attendees from other Australian universities should find out (from the IT website of
  their home institution) how to connect to the Eduroam wireless network.
</p>

<h3>Create a DIT4C Account</h3>
<p>
  During the week prior to the workshop, one of the instructors will email you the 
  compute node name and access code you'll need for the Data Intensive Tools for 
  the Cloud (DIT4C) environment that is hosted on the NeCTAR Research Cloud. Once you've 
  got that name and code, navigate to 
  the <a href="http://dit4c.metadata.net">DIT4C homepage</a> and follow these instructions:
  <ol>
    <li>Click the "login" button and proceed to login. You can use your institution 
    username and password if you're at an Australian university, otherwise use your 
    GitHub credentials (everyone creates a GitHub account during the Git lessons anyway, 
    so you'll just be getting in early).</li>
    <li>Go to the "compute nodes" tab and click "claim compute node access".</li>
    <li>From the drop down menu, select the name of the compute node that the instructor 
    emailed to you and enter the corresponding access code.</li>
    <li>Go to the "containers" tab and add a new container named after yourself 
    (e.g. johnsmith). The reason for this is that container names are unique (i.e. you can't 
    have the same container name as anyone else in the room). Select an "RStudio" image 
    from the drop down menu and then hit the create button.</li>
    <li>When the container is "on", its name should turn blue and you can click on it to 
    launch your environment in a new tab of your browser.</li>
    <li>Once you're finished for the day, simply close all the extra tabs that have opened up 
    and turn your container "off". When you come back tomorrow, simply switch back to the 'on' 
    position to continue using that container.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h3 id="software_install">(Optional) Software Installation</h3>

<p>
  The DIT4C environment comes with all the required software pre-installed, however if you would like to
  install the software on your own computer (either before or after the workshop), here are the
  instructions to do so.
</p>


<div> <!-- Start of 'editor' section. -->
  <h4>Text Editor</h4>

  <p>
    When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text editor that is
    optimized for writing code, with features like automatic
    color-coding of key words.  The default text editor on Mac OS X and
    Linux is usually set to Vim, which is not famous for being
    intuitive.  if you accidentally find yourself stuck in it, try
    typing the escape key, followed by ':q!' (colon, lower-case 'q',
    exclamation mark), then hitting Return to return to the shell.
  </p>

  <div class="row-fluid">
    <div class="span4">
      <h5>Windows</h5>
      <p>
	<code>nano</code> is the editor installed by the Software
	Carpentry Installer, it is a basic editor integrated into the
	lesson material.
      </p>
      <p>
	<a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> is a
	popular free code editor for Windows.  Be aware that you must
	add its installation directory to your system path in order to
	launch it from the command line (or have other tools like Git
	launch it for you).  Please ask your instructor to help you do
	this.

    <div class="span4">
      <h5>Mac OS X</h5>
      <p>
	We recommend
	<a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">Text Wrangler</a> or
	<a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>.
	In a pinch, you can use <code>nano</code>,
	which should be pre-installed.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
      <h5>Linux</h5>
      <p>
	<a href="http://kate-editor.org/">Kate</a> is one option for

    <div class="span4">
      <h5>Linux</h5>
      <p>

  <h4>Git</h4>

  <p>
    Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes
    to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public
    version of your code
    on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>.
  </p>

  <div class="row-fluid">
    <div class="span4">

    <div class="span4">
      <h5>Mac OS X</h5>
      <p>
        <strong>For OS X 10.8 and higher</strong>, install Git for Mac
        by downloading and running
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/latest/download">the installer</a>.
        After installing Git, there will not be anything in your <code>/Applications</code> folder,
        as Git is a command line program.
        <strong>For older versions of OS X (10.5-10.7)</strong> use the
        most recent available installer for your
        OS <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">available
        here</a>. Use the Leopard installer for 10.5 and the Snow
